        This project aims to predict the likelihood of individuals taking the H1N1 flu vaccine using Logistic Regression by analyzing a dataset containing various features related to individuals' behaviors, 
        perceptions, and demographics. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, education level, health status, and preventive behaviors like handwashing and mask-wearing. 
        The data preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features to prepare the data for accurate modeling. 
        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover patterns and relationships within the data, providing insights into key factors influencing vaccine acceptance.
        
        By building a predictive model, we can estimate the probability of vaccine acceptance for different individuals based on their characteristics and attitudes. 
        This model aids healthcare professionals and policymakers in effectively targeting vaccination campaigns, ensuring that efforts are directed towards populations that are less likely to receive the vaccine and require more encouragement. 
        The ultimate goal is to enhance public health strategies, improve vaccination rates, and better manage the spread of the H1N1 flu by understanding and addressing the factors that influence individuals' decisions to get vaccinated.
